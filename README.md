* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:
